ENTIRE GAME ON ONE SCREEN...
Possibly the worse theme we could have gotten!! :)

Looking for ideas....

OK, let's go for a platformer...

THE END IS FAR

Platformer where you have to survive through the credits.

Starts off with character on screen, with a small purpose like clicking the start button / end button
Then the credits start rolling... Except they are full of dangers and try to kill you as they roll up

If I have time... I'd love to implement some weapons / items:
- a hook
- a bow with ennemies

ENGINE TASKS:
[X] : Character controls, platform feel
[ ] : Create 3d Text Models and have them roll up
[ ] : Engine dynamics
[ ] : Death
[ ] : Traps : saws, bouncy stuffs, arrows


Almost 7AM... Time to call it a night...
